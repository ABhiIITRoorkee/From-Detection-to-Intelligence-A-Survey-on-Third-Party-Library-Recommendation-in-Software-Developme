---

Third-party libraries (TPLs) play a crucial role in modern software development by providing reusable components, saving time, and reducing development costs. However, the increasing reliance on TPLs raises concerns about security vulnerabilities, dependency management, and privacy risks. These libraries' accurate detection and analysis are paramount for ensuring robust software systems.

This repository presents a curated collection of resources, including research papers, tools, datasets, and methodologies focused on third-party library detection. The aim is to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive guide to understanding this domain's state of the art. We regularly update this repository with the latest advancements and open-source implementations.

## Motivation

## **Motivation**
Third-party libraries (TPLs) are essential to modern software development, enabling faster development cycles and improved functionality. However, their usage also introduces **critical challenges**, including:
- **Security vulnerabilities** – Outdated or malicious libraries can compromise software security.
- **Privacy risks** – Some libraries collect or expose sensitive user data without proper disclosure.
- **Dependency conflicts** – Compatibility issues arise due to version mismatches and transitive dependencies.
- **Licensing and compliance concerns** – Ensuring legal adherence to open-source licenses.
- **Scalability and explainability** – Intelligent recommendation models must balance performance, interpretability, and efficiency.

This repository consolidates research on **TPL detection and recommendation** techniques, with a particular focus on **machine learning, graph-based models, and interactive intelligent systems**.

### Static Analysis

Static analysis examines the software's source code or binary files without executing the application. This approach leverages techniques such as:
- Signature-based matching of library files.
- Pattern recognition in code dependencies.

**Examples of tools and techniques**:
- **LibRadar**: Detects libraries in Android APKs using hash-based techniques.
- **Androguard**: Performs reverse engineering of APK files for library identification.

Static analysis is lightweight and efficient but may miss dynamically loaded or obfuscated libraries.


### Dynamic Analysis
Techniques that evaluate libraries during runtime.

### Hybrid Approaches
