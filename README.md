Third-party libraries (TPLs) play a crucial role in modern software development by providing reusable components, saving time, and reducing development costs. However, the increasing reliance on TPLs raises concerns about security vulnerabilities, dependency management, and privacy risks. These libraries' accurate detection and analysis are paramount for ensuring robust software systems.

This repository presents a curated collection of resources, including research papers, tools, datasets, and methodologies focused on third-party library detection. The aim is to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive guide to understanding this domain's state of the art. We regularly update this repository with the latest advancements and open-source implementations.

## Motivation

The reliance on third-party libraries has become integral to modern software development, offering faster development cycles and robust functionality. However, this dependence introduces challenges such as:
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: TPLs often serve as an attack vector for malicious activities.
- **Privacy Risks**: Libraries may expose sensitive user data to third parties.
- **Dependency Management**: Ensuring compatibility and reducing version conflicts is crucial.
- **Legal and Licensing Issues**: Understanding and complying with library licenses is critical to avoid legal repercussions.

A systematic understanding of TPL detection techniques enables better management, enhanced security, and improved software quality.

### Static Analysis

Static analysis examines the software's source code or binary files without executing the application. This approach leverages techniques such as:
- Signature-based matching of library files.
- Pattern recognition in code dependencies.

**Examples of tools and techniques**:
- **LibRadar**: Detects libraries in Android APKs using hash-based techniques.
- **Androguard**: Performs reverse engineering of APK files for library identification.

Static analysis is lightweight and efficient but may miss dynamically loaded or obfuscated libraries.


### Dynamic Analysis
Techniques that evaluate libraries during runtime.

### Hybrid Approaches
A combination of static and dynamic techniques.
